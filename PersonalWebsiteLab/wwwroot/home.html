        "With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, our friendly neighborhood web-slinger is unmasked and no longer able to separate his 
        normal life as Peter Parker from the high stakes of being a superhero. 
        When Peter asks for help from Doctor Strange, 
        the stakes become even more dangerous, 
        forcing him to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man."</blockquote>

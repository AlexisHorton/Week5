        What is Spider-Man's "spider-sense"?

            Spider-sense is one of Spidey’s main and important powers that Spider-Man has that makes him the Spider-Man.
            That specific power allows Spider-Man to sense any upcoming attack and sense any danger that closes in on him.
            The power helps Spider-Man into not getting hurt and defending himself from a punch or kick. The good sides of
            having Spider-sense is that you can react quickly to an attack and counter-attack it by using Spider-sense. <hr />
            You can also use it to sense danger nearby or if something is starting to get creepy. But there are bad sides
            to it too, sadly. Spider-sense only tingles when a MENACE or an ENEMY is going to attack you, not your friends
            or family. So what if a bully is about to surprise you by smashing your head into a tree? Spider-sense would
            quickly tingle and allow you to react quickly. But if your friend tries to slap you, then it won’t tingle because
            it’ll know that he’s your friend and that he’s probably doing it for a joke, but he’s doing it for real.
            Overall Spider-sense is a SUPER useful power to have and really helps Spider-Man.

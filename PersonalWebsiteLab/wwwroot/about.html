            "Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, young Peter Parker returns home to live with his Aunt May.
            Under the watchful eye of mentor Tony Stark, Parker starts to embrace his newfound identity as Spider-Man.
            He also tries to return to his normal daily routine -- distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more
            than just a friendly neighborhood superhero. Peter must soon put his powers to the test when the evil Vulture
            emerges to threaten everything that he holds dear."

    <h2>
        The Avengers introduce the idea of the "Multi-Verse"
    </h2>
    <p>
        <blockquote style="color:">
            The Multiverse is the aggregate of all dimensions and parallel realities in existence. 
            Although dimensions are just portions of reality within a universe, there are also parallel 
            universes that coexist with one another. The Multiverse is believed to be explained by the 
            eternal inflation system, however, the exact nature of its existence is largely unknown to its inhabitants.
